@author: Talardia Gbangou, October 2022

Objective:
This notebok contains the results of the data exploration and building of a machine learning model to predict the success and failure of application of the position of chercheur d’or chez OrFée.

Project: 
This project writes a functional and structured code in python using a jupyter notebook. It contains the following steps:

1. Descriptives statistics
Here some exploratory data analysis is performed to undertand the data and make the first conclusion on features selection for the prediction

1.1. Data description

* importing relevent libraries
* load dataset
* checking influence of some features on the target or depedent variable
* checking wether we have balanced or imbalance dataset
* find and treatting missing dataset
* converting categorical data

1.2. Significance test: we used sveral stattistical tests techniiques dependending the variables considered:
* a) for significance test between two categorical nominal variables we used CHI-SQUARE test
* b) for significance test between a categorical and numerical variable, we used anova test
* c) for significance test between two numerical variables we used ttest




1. A PDF document : containing answers to questions    (Reponses_quantmetry_test.pdf)

2. A zip folder that contains the code written in python using a jupyter notebook (Python 3.9.7). The code is named: embauche.ipynb

Data used: data_v1.0.csv
